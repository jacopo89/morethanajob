        <h2>How we process your data</h2>
        <p>We will process and store your data solely for the above-mentioned purposes, using digital
            and analogical devices and in relevant databases ensuring appropriate safeguards so as
            to guarantee ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing
            systems, as set out by EU regulation 2016/679. Only subjects who have obtained access
            to personal data from the controller or the processor can process such information. Data
            can be used and collected by third parties (i.e. data centres or corporations). These
            organisations shall be appointed as processor and should comply with legal regulations
            and contractual obligations related to the existing juridical relation.</p>

        <h2>Social networks</h2>
        <p>Our website may offer access to social networks. The terms of service and Privacy Policy
            applicable to such platforms are published on their website. CESIE cannot control the way
            data shared on a public forum, chat or dashboard are used, being the data subject
            responsible of such communication.</p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>As set out by regulation n°229 of May 8th, 2014 of the Italian Data Protection Authority,there are two main categories of cookies:</p>
        <h3>Technical cookies</h3>
        <p>These are used for the sole purpose of “transmitting communications to an electronic
            communication network, or to the extent strictly necessary for the provision of a service by
            the information company explicitly requested by the contracting party or the user in order
            to provide the said service”. These are not used for any ulterior purposes and they are
            normally installed directly by the owner or the manager of the website (so-called
            “proprietary” or “editorial” cookies). These can be divided into: browsing or session
            cookies, which guarantee normal navigation and use of the website (making it possible for
            example, to make purchases or be authenticated in order to access reserved areas);
            analytics cookies assimilated by the technical cookies where they are used directly by the
            manager of the website to collect information, in an associated form (anonymous), about
            the number of users and the manner in which they visit the website; functional cookies that
            allow the user to navigate in relation to a series of select criteria (for example, the
            language or the products selected for purchase) in order to improve the service provided,
            provided that we inform our users as set out by article 13 EU Regulation 2016/679.
            Informed consent is not required for such cookies.</p>
        <h3>Profiling cookies</h3>
        <p>These are used to create profiles of the users and are employed for sending advertising
            messages according to the preferences shown during their online activity. Due to their
            invasiveness with regard to the users’ private sphere, European and Italian regulations
            require that users are adequately informed about their use and are thus required to
            express their valid consent. An Internet page, such as an online newspaper, contains
            several objects and each domain can set cookies, therefore web browsers allow, and
            support such technology. Their purpose is to register, and trace information connected to
            users’ experience, as they journey between pages, they recognise the users and
            remember their preferences and settings when they return to the website, in order to
            deliver relevant contents and advertising. Disabling profiling cookies may have a negative
            impact on users’ browsing experience.</p>
