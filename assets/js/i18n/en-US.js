        "projectPre":"This portal is developed as part of the ENI CBC MED project “MoreThanAJob - Reinforcing social and solidarity economy for the unemployed, uneducated and refugees” aiming at fostering the social and labour inclusion of vulnerable groups through a stronger cooperation between SSE actors and public administrations.",
        "projectMore":"The MoreThanAJob project aims at enhancing the development of cooperation mechanism between the Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) and the public administration to improve the social services for vulnerable groups in order to increase their opportunities of social and labour inclusion. \n" +
            "Improving the cooperation between these two main actors and their different realities will foster the development of innovative and more effective services able to respond to the social and economic challenges of our societies, particularly in the aftermath of the Covid19 emergency. Indeed, this emergency has highlighted how a solid welfare system is essential to protect the weaker segments, ensure fairer societies and that each citizen has the same rights and opportunities.\n" +
            "MoreThanAJob will bring a change in the way SSE actors and public institutions work together for services provision to vulnerable groups through the development of a framework of new social pilot schemes as well as the development of policy briefs and suggestions improving the planning of policies adapted to the needs of the target groups. \n" +
            "The project is funded by the ENI CBC Programme 2014-2020 and involves partners from five different countries: Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Greece and Italy. \n",
