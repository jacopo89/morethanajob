Indeed, this emergency has highlighted how a solid welfare system is essential to protect the weaker segments, ensure fairer societies and that each citizen has the same rights and opportunities.\n" +
            "MoreThanAJob will bring a change in the way SSE actors and public institutions work together for services provision to vulnerable groups through the development of a framework of new social pilot schemes as well as the development of policy briefs and suggestions improving the planning of policies adapted to the needs of the target groups. \n" +
